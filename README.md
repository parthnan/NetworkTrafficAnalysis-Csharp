# Modeling Networks for Traffic Analysis 
An Object Oriented Approach to evaluating average waiting times for users of in Communication Networks, using basic Queuing theory(read:Kendall's Notation). Used Student's t-test for confidence interval analysis of estimated waiting time(explained below). 

Used Visual Studio .NET Core environment to build .NET Apps that do the following:
