# Modeling Networks for Traffic Analysis 
An Object Oriented Approach to evaluating average waiting times for users of in Communication Networks, using basic Queuing theory(read:Kendall's Notation). Used Student's t-test for confidence interval analysis of estimated waiting time(explained below). 

Used Visual Studio .NET Core environment to build .NET Apps that do the following: 

EventDrivenSimulation v1.1 : 

EventDrivenSimulation v1.2 : 

EventDrivenSimulation v1.3 : 

EventDrivenSimulation v2.0 : 

# Challenges Overcame
Learned a lot about Network theory and Network Performance by simulating basic Networks. The challenge during coding was making sure the correct network events were picked up at correct times, while adapting to OOP in C#. The results were in accordance with basic queuing theory.
